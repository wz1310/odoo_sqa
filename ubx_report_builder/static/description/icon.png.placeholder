# Report Builder Icon Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the module icon. 
In a production environment, you would replace this with an actual PNG icon file (64x64 pixels recommended).

The icon should be named 'icon.png' and placed in the static/description/ directory.

For now, the module will use the default Odoo application icon.
